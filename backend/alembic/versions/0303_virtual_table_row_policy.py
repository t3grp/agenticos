"""One row-level access policy per virtual table.

A table's `row_policy` is a JSON document naming the rule and the columns that
drive it (see `RowPolicy` in `app/schemas/virtual_table.py`): the assignee rule
keeps a row visible to the members its Assignee column names, with view wider
than edit. It is data, not SQL - the service evaluates it - so the policy is
reviewable and testable, and a table without one behaves exactly as before.

One nullable column on the table, not a side table: one policy per table, read
on every record operation alongside the table row that is already loaded, so
there is no extra join and no second lookup. A side table would only pay off if
policies needed versioning or an audit trail of their own; they do not - a
policy change goes through the audit log like any other table mutation.
`NULL` means no policy, so existing tables need no backfill.
