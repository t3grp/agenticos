"""Time-based one-time passwords (RFC 6238) for console sign-in.

No third-party dependency: the algorithm is HMAC-SHA1 over a time counter,
and the standard library carries all of it. The secret is a 160-bit value in
base32 - the shape every authenticator app expects - and the code is six
digits over a 30-second step, the default every authenticator app assumes.

Verification accepts the step before and after the current one, so a code
typed as the step turns over still lands. Anything further out is refused:
a wider window is a wider guessable surface, and the authenticator's own
clock is the thing to fix when codes keep missing.
