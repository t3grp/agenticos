        Use it when a watch wakes you with new check output: pass the
        repo, PR number, head SHA, and the checks as `gh pr checks`
        reports them. It reports only what changed since the last
        snapshot, names each failed check real or flake with its
        reason, and says what to do next — keep watching, act on a
        failure, or stop because the bots are green on the latest
        commit. When nothing changed and the watch continues, the
        report is empty: end your turn without a message, never post
        or say "still waiting". It never merges, comments, or takes
        any other action on the PR.

        Args:
            repo: The repository as `owner/name`.
            pr_number: The pull request number.
            head_sha: The commit the checks ran on. A new head
                re-opens the question: green on the last commit is
                never green on this one.
            checks: One entry per check run, with `name`, `status`,
                `conclusion`, and the failure text as `detail` when
                it failed. Entries without a name are dropped and
                counted, not fatal.

            the head moved, the events (only the checks that changed),
            the decision, the reason, the report text, and how many
            seconds until the next poll — 0 when the watch has ended.
            A refusal string instead when the repo, PR number, or
            head is missing, or when another PR is already being
            watched.
