"""Watch a pull request through CI, reporting only what changed (#7).

The watcher holds one watch per run: the agent hands it a snapshot
of the PR's checks whenever the monitor wakes it, and the watcher
says what changed and what to do next. The capability never runs
`gh` itself and never touches the PR — no merge, no comment, no
other action. Reading the checks is the agent's job (``gh pr
checks`` under the monitor capability); classifying them is this
capability's.
