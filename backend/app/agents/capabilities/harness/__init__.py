"""Harness - a local CLI session as an agent's working backend.

A general agent with a shell can edit code; a coding harness is better at it,
and Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI and Pi all run headless. The coding
agent hands one task to one of them and reports back. This capability goes one
step further: the agent is *backed by* a harness session - one of those CLIs in
the agent's sandbox - that it drives across turns, starting one session per line
of work and prompting it as the work proceeds, while a person watches.

An agent with this capability is a harness-backed agent; another agent reaches
it the way it reaches any specialist, through delegation, so "ask the harness
agent" and "hand this to the finance agent" are the same act.
