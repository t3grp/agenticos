"""Where a conversation's harness sessions live, and how they are remembered.

A harness session is the CLI's own session - the id Claude Code or Codex
prints - kept beside the work, per conversation and per session name, so a
follow-up prompt continues the same work without the model carrying ids
around. The id is not a credential: it names a conversation the CLI already
holds, and it is stored in the workspace rather than the database because the
workspace is what a conversation's runs already share.

This deliberately does not reuse the coding agent's session files: a harness
session is the agent's working backend for a stream of prompts, not one task
handed off, and the two must never continue each other's sessions.
