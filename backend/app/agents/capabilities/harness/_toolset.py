"""`harness_start`, `harness_prompt`, `harness_stop` and `harness_sessions`.

One idea, four tools: a CLI session - Claude Code or Codex in the agent's
sandbox - that the agent drives across turns as its working backend, instead
of firing one-off tasks at it. The session is the CLI's own: its id is kept
beside the work, so a follow-up prompt continues the same conversation, with
the same files and context the earlier prompts left.

What the model must not choose is closed over: which harness, what it may do,
its model and its key. It chooses the session and what to say to it. Whether
a person says yes first is the binding's approval, like any other tool's.
