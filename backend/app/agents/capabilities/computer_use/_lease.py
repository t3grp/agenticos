"""One run at a time may observe or drive a shared sandbox desktop.

The workspace can outlive a conversation, and toolset sequencing is local to
one run. Redis owns this lease so separate workers agree on who has the screen.
Human takeover uses the same computer and keeps the run's lease. A lost lease
never reacquires itself: the model's old coordinates no longer describe a
desktop it owns.

This fences calls through computer use, not shell commands in the workspace.
A command already dispatched cannot be recalled if a worker stalls past the
lease's TTL; the next operation is refused. The TTL exceeds the sandbox's
60-second command timeout and is renewed while the model or viewer is idle.
