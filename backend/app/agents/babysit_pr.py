"""Babysit a pull request through CI and review bots (#7).

Theo's tstack ``babysit-pr`` skill, T3OS-ised as pure logic: the watcher
classifies one snapshot of a PR's checks at a time, reports only what
changed since the last snapshot, and says when to stop. It never merges,
comments, or takes any other action on the PR — watching and reporting
only. The agent obtains snapshots itself (``gh pr checks`` under the
monitor capability) and hands them to the ``babysit_pr`` capability's
tools; this module is what those tools call.

Rules carried over from the skill, enforced here rather than left to
prompt:

- Only the current commit's checks count: a snapshot for a new head
  re-opens the question, and green on an old head is never green.
- A wake is news, not a merge decision. When nothing changed, the
  report is empty — the agent stays quiet, never "still waiting".
- Real failures and infrastructure flakes are different things. A
  flake is named with its reason so the agent can dismiss it with a
  written reason; a real failure is named so the agent can fix it.
  The classification is a heuristic over the check's own failure
  text, and the agent verifies every finding against the source
  before acting on it.
- One watcher per PR, and only the thread that owns the PR watches
  it. A delegated child never watches.
- Never watch in a tight loop: polls are floored at
  :data:`MIN_POLL_SECONDS`, and when the GitHub rate limit is nearly
  used up the watcher waits for its reset instead of polling.
