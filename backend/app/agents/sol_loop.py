"""A sol-loop review: one reviewer judges the work, in rounds, until it passes.

The shape is Theo's tstack sol-loop skill, as a domain module with no database
and no service imports, so it can be tested without a run: one reviewer - the
operator's Sol model, resolved by the runner - reviews the work in rounds. Round
1 is full; later rounds check only changed code and open findings. The agent
fixes what the reviewer found between rounds and calls again, until the loop
stops.

Three rules from the skill are load-bearing here and worth stating where the
code enforces them:

- **Budget end is not approval.** :func:`round_satisfied` needs an APPROVE on
  the current diff with no blocker or should open. A round that runs out of
  budget with either still open records ``budget_exhausted`` and is not
  satisfied.
- **Stop early on nits only.** A round whose findings are all nits stops the
  loop with ``nits_only`` - declined nits need no new round.
- **An unavailable reviewer is reported, never substituted.** A reviewer with
  no model, or whose review raises - including a budget cap skipping the call -
  records as ``unavailable`` with the reason, and the round stops with
  ``reviewer_unavailable``. Substituting another model would review with a
  reviewer the operator did not choose.
