    """The sentence a failed run may store, for an exception it may not.

    `agent_runs.error` used to hold `str(exc)` of whatever came out of the run.
    It is a stored column on `AgentRunRead`, rendered in run history to every
    member who can read it, and what raises there is a model client with `httpx`
    underneath - so that routinely meant an endpoint, an internal host, or a URL
    with a key still in its query string, sitting in a row somebody opens weeks
    later. Same rule as #342 in an HTTP body, #423 in the ingestion columns and
    #659 in the chat frame, with the longest life of the four (#676). A
    delegated run's row takes it through `TaskHandle.exception`, which is why
    the parameter is `BaseException` - that is what the library's retry
    callback receives (#699).

    Ours is kept whole. An `AppException` raised inside the run is written in
    this repository, and its message is the most useful thing an operator can be
    shown - "No model profile is configured for this agent" beats any sentence
    composed here. (The one place that folds a foreign `__str__` into an
    `AppException` is `sandbox_workspace._reason`, deliberately and for a route's
    answer; it runs in a route service, outside every run a caller settles.)
    `BudgetExceeded` must not reach this function - each caller catches or
    filters it first, because its ceiling sentence is the point of it.

    Anything else is a foreign `__str__` and only its *type* is safe to store,
    plus the status code when a provider answered one. That code is what keeps
    the failures a person can act on themselves actionable - 401 a credential,
    404 a model the profile names and the provider does not have, 429 a rate
    limit, 400 a request the model refused - where a bare class name would make
    all four `ModelHTTPError`. An `int` has never carried a URL. A 402 has a
    sentence of its own, because the generic advice to retry is wrong for it.

    A group is unwrapped to its first leaf first, the same unwrapping
    `failure_summary` and `probe_error_message` do. MCP toolsets and delegated
    runs sit on anyio task groups, so their failures arrive as an
    `ExceptionGroup` whose own name diagnoses nothing at all - which would spend
    the status code above on the failures most likely to carry one.
