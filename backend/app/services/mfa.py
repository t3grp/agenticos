"""Two-factor authentication for console sign-in, via TOTP.

Enrolment is three steps: begin setup (a secret is sealed under the user's
own vault scope and the provisioning URI is shown once), enable (the
authenticator proves it can produce a code, and ten single-use recovery
codes are handed back once), and from then on every password sign-in stops
at a second step until the code - or a recovery code - is given.

The secret lives sealed (see `app/core/vault.py`): a database read alone
never yields it, and it cannot be unwrapped for another user. Recovery codes
are stored as SHA-256 digests, the way refresh tokens are stored as theirs.
A password change bumps `credential_version`, which is what invalidates an
MFA challenge minted before it - the same claim the refresh gate uses.
