"""Fulfilling and declining a secret request (#13).

The card posts here, never to the chat: the value arrives as a `SecretStr`
on the fulfil body, is sealed straight into the vault by
`OrganizationSecretService.create`, and is dropped the moment the seal
returns. What is kept - on the request row and in the run's parked state -
is the created secret's id, name and hint, and the safe acknowledgement
string the model reads on resume. Nothing in this module logs, audits or
returns the value, and no code path after the seal holds it.

A fulfil resumes the run only when every secret it parked on is in and no
question is still unanswered; until then the run stays parked and the card
stays up for the remaining requests. A decline ends the run failed, with
the refusal as its error, rather than resuming a model that would ask
again.
