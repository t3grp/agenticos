 * What the model was given, which nothing else in the product shows.
 *
 * The prompt here is not the spec's text: it is the spec's plus the platform's
 * plus whatever a binding appended plus the bound skills', recorded from the
 * wire. Same for the tools - the registry plus the organization's MCP servers
 * minus whatever tool search hid. So the panel's claim is "this is what was
 * sent", and the tests below are about the two ways that claim can be broken:
 * by drawing a record that was trimmed as though it were complete, and by
 * drawing a run that recorded nothing as a run that was given nothing.
